# Evolution of Artificial Intelligence: A Historical Perspective and Algorithm Implementation

Welcome to the Evolution of Artificial Intelligence from Simple AI to Advanced Transformer ! This project explores the history of artificial intelligence (AI) by implementing various significant algorithms (e.g., search, neural networks, reinforcement learning in algorithms order) and discussing their evolution over time. The project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI's development, from its inception to the present day, and highlight the key milestones and breakthroughs that have shaped the field.

### Viewing the Project
To view the project, you can choose one of the following options:

* Online: Open the project using this link: https://nmkzzztos.github.io/AI_methods/. (github repo: https://github.com/nmkzzztos/AI_methods)
* Local: Open the index.html file in your browser. Note that there might be issues with JavaScript when using this method.
* PDF: If the above options do not work, you can find PDF copies of the HTML pages in the docs folder (forget not about algorithm implementations in the algorithms folder).

### Acknowledgments
I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Prof. Dr. Thomas Rist for providing a script that described various aspects of AI, which was incredibly helpful in understanding various complex concepts and implementing the algorithms.

### Usage of ChatGPT
ChatGPT was instrumental in this project for several key reasons:

* Translation: Assisted in translating various documentation and comments within the code to ensure clarity and comprehension across different languages.
* Code Assistance: Provided guidance and suggestions during the coding process, helping to debug and optimize the implementation of algorithms.
* Error Correction: Helped identify and correct errors in the code, ensuring robust and accurate implementations.
